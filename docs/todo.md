- [~] Insert statements (10 rows of real data in each table, others can be generated)
        - Note: Data was inserted into 12 out of 27 tables, and data was generated in 2 of them.
- [~] 20 queries (covering the entire material, Regular Kif, Modern SQL)
- [~] The whole project in NEVprojekt.sql
        - Note: The project can be found in several .sql files, which can also be seen in the github repository.
- [~] Transfer the entire project to another ABKR
        - Note: All 27 tables have been rewritten in the MySQL (MariaDB) database management system, but the data has not yet been transferred.
- [~] Create a visual interface (as much as we learn about it)
        - Note: The visual interface was only solved in python due to complications, and it works partially (create, update unfortunately do not work yet) but what is currently working is universal for any of the 27 tables.
